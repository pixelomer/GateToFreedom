# GateToFreedom

## History

This tweak was supposed to be shipped with unc0ver. Pwn20wnd had asked me to make this tweak. However, Pwn20wnd started ghosting me after I finished working on it so this tweak was never released in binary form.

## Original Description

Setup tweak for jailbroken iDevices.

### Known bugs (sorted from high to low priority)

- The user can escape the setup by opening an application using either the notification center or the control center.
- The user can escape the setup by either pressing power button 5 times in a row if SOS is enabled or by holding the power button.
